When debugging new problems, I follow a systematic approach: first, I reproduce the issue in a minimal example. Then, I carefully read error messages and trace back through the code. I consult documentation or use AI assistants for insights, applying small fixes step by step until I identify the root cause. For instance, in my Diabetes Predictor project, this method helped me resolve a complex issue with data preprocessing that was affecting model accuracy. ---\n### What do you value in a team?\nI thrive in collaborative, respectful teams where feedback is shared openly. --- ### How do you debug new problems?\nI isolate variables, run small experiments, and keep detailed notes for reproducibility. --- ### What energizes you?\nCreative problem-solving, collaborating with motivated peers, and seeing research applied.\n### Where do I want to grow next?
