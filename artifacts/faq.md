# FAQ

**Why FAISS over a hosted vector DB?**  
Local, simple, zero infra for a personal codex.

**Can I add new docs without rebuilding locally?**  
Yes — use the sidebar uploader → **Save & Re-index**.

**What if the model says “not enough context”?**  
That’s intended grounding. Add the relevant doc to `/data/` (e.g., RL project notes).

**Can it answer general ML questions?**  
Only lightly; scope is me-as-candidate. It will nudge back to my work.
