Work Style & Values
How I Work

I approach projects with a balance of structure and experimentation. I like to break problems down into clear steps, but I also leave room for testing new ideas and iterating quickly. For me, shipping something functional early — even a simple prototype — is important, because it creates momentum and makes improvement easier.

I use a lot of AI-assisted coding tools like GitHub Copilot and ChatGPT to help with boilerplate and brainstorming. This lets me spend my energy on system design, debugging, and experimenting with creative solutions.

Debugging & Learning

When I face an unfamiliar bug or concept, my process is:

Reproduce the issue in a minimal example.

Read error messages carefully and trace back through the code.

Check docs or use AI assistants to suggest explanations.

Apply small fixes step by step until I understand the root cause.

I treat debugging as a chance to learn the system more deeply rather than just “fix the error fast.”

Team & Collaboration

I value clear communication and knowledge sharing. I like when teammates explain their thought process openly and invite feedback. In turn, I make an effort to write clean commit messages, comments, and READMEs so that others can follow my reasoning.

I also enjoy collaborative brainstorming — bouncing half-formed ideas off others and shaping them into something stronger.

What Energises Me

Working on AI projects that have real-world impact (healthcare, education, tools that empower people).

Learning new frameworks and then applying them in practice.

Building demos that make abstract concepts interactive and tangible.

What Drains Me

Long periods of purely repetitive work without opportunities to experiment.

Poor communication loops where progress stalls because of misalignment.

Growth Goals

Deepen my expertise in reinforcement learning and generative AI.

Gain more real-world experience in productionising ML systems.

Contribute to projects where AI helps people stay present and empowered, not replaced.
