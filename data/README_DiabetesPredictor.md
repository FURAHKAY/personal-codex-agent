# Diabetes-Predictive-Healthcare-Model
This project implements a neural network-based classifier to predict the likelihood of diabetes using patient medical records. 
----
This project uses the Pima Diabetes dataset to train a predictive model that forecasts the likelihood of diabetes in patients based on features such as:
- Glucose level
- Blood pressure
- BMI
- Insulin levels
- Age
- Diabetes pedigree function
- Skin thickness
- Number of pregnancies

It simulates how predictive analytics can aid in early diagnosis and preventive healthcare decisions.
