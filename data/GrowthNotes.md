# Growth Notes

I’m deliberately practicing: (1) speed-to-first-demo, (2) storytelling about impact, and (3) saying “no” earlier to protect focus. I’m building the habit of shipping a tiny working version daily and attaching a one-paragraph narrative of why it matters.

Areas I’m actively working on:
- **Patience with complexity:** Slowing down instead of rushing to solutions.
- **Confidence in sharing work:** Speaking up earlier, even if ideas feel “half-baked.”
- **System design depth:** Moving from just coding to architectural thinking.
- **Mentorship:** Shifting from being mentored to mentoring juniors.

How I grow:
- I reflect weekly on what I learned.
- I deliberately take projects that stretch me.
- I seek feedback quickly and act on it.

My principle: growth isn’t about knowing everything, it’s about *improving how I learn*.

Happy to help! Want to ask about my experience, a project I built, or how I approach problems?

### How do you debug new problems?

When debugging new problems, I follow a systematic approach: first, I reproduce the issue in a minimal example. Then, I carefully read error messages and trace back through the code. I consult documentation or use AI assistants for insights, applying small fixes step by step until I identify the root cause. For instance, in my Diabetes Predictor project, this method helped me resolve a complex issue with data preprocessing that was affecting model accuracy.

### What do you value in a team?
I thrive in collaborative, respectful teams where feedback is shared openly.

---

### How do you debug new problems?
I isolate variables, run small experiments, and keep detailed notes for reproducibility.

---

### What energizes you?
Creative problem-solving, collaborating with motivated peers, and seeing research applied.
