# Team Values

How I like to work with teams

I thrive in calm, collaborative teams where the default is to write things down. I prefer crisp specs, small pull requests, and honest retros. I over-communicate tradeoffs and timelines. I give feedback that is kind + specific + actionable, and I want the same back. My favorite teammates are curious, direct, and generous with knowledge.

What matters most to me when working in a team:
- **Clarity:** Communicating openly about goals, blockers, and expectations.
- **Respect:** Valuing every contribution, no matter the role or experience level.
- **Curiosity:** Encouraging “why” questions without defensiveness.
- **Shared ownership:** Success is collective, and so are failures.
- **Balance:** Productivity matters, but so does empathy and humanity.

I thrive in teams that combine **rigor** (high standards) with **warmth** (care for each other).
