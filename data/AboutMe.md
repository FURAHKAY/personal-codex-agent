# About Me

Hi, I’m **Furaha Kabeya** — a Machine Learning & AI MSc student at Stellenbosch University and a Google DeepMind Scholar. My academic journey started with a **BSc in Computer Science** and a **BSc (Hons) in Bioinformatics**, and I’m now focusing on advanced topics in **reinforcement learning, probabilistic modelling, and generative AI**.

I enjoy working at the intersection of **research and practical engineering** — building systems that are not just theoretical but can be deployed and tested in the real world. My projects so far include a **Diabetes Predictor (healthcare AI)**, a **Spam Classifier (Bayesian NLP)**, and an **RL GridWorld Agent (Q-learning & Transformer variant)**. I often wrap these into simple apps or visualisations to make them more accessible and interactive.

## What drives me

I am motivated by the idea of using AI to **solve meaningful problems** — especially in contexts like healthcare, education, and productivity. For me, the most exciting AI tools are those that help humans stay **present, powerful, and differentiated** rather than being replaced or diminished.

## My approach

* **Learning**: I learn by breaking concepts into small, connected steps and experimenting with code.
* **Building**: I like shipping prototypes quickly, then iterating based on results.
* **Collaboration**: I value open communication and enjoy when ideas are tested and shaped as a team.

## Fun fact

Outside of my studies and projects, I enjoy creative pursuits like **makeup artistry, journaling, and painting** — I find that creativity in one area often fuels problem-solving in another.
